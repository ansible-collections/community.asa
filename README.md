# Ansible Collection - community.asa

[![CI](https://zuul-ci.org/gated.svg)](https://dashboard.zuul.ansible.com/t/ansible/project/github.com/ansible-collections/community.asa) <!--[![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible-collections/community)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible-collections/community.asa)--> 

This repo hosts the `community.asa` Ansible Collection.

The collection includes the community plugins to help the management of Cisco ASA hosts.


## Installation and Usage

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the Community Cisco ASA collection, you need to install it with the `ansible-galaxy` CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.asa

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: community.asa
```


## Testing and Development

If you want to develop new content for this collection or improve what's already here, the easiest way to work on the collection is to clone it into one of the configured [`COLLECTIONS_PATHS`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#collections-paths), and work on it there.

### Testing with `ansible-test`

The `tests` directory contains configuration for running sanity and integration tests using [`ansible-test`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing_integration.html).

You can run the collection's test suites with the commands:

    ansible-test sanity --docker
    ansible-test network-integration --inventory /path/to/inventory tests_to_run


## Publishing New Version

The current process for publishing new versions of the Cisco ASA Community Collection is manual, and requires a user who has access to the `community` namespace on Ansible Galaxy to publish the build artifact.

  1. Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` contains all the latest changes.
  2. Update `galaxy.yml` with the new `version` for the collection.
  3. Create a release in GitHub to tag the commit at the version to build.
  4. Run the following commands to build and release the new version on Galaxy:

     ```
     ansible-galaxy collection build
     ansible-galaxy collection publish ./community-asa-$VERSION_HERE.tar.gz
     ```

After the version is published, verify it exists on the [Cisco ASA Community Collection Galaxy page](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/asa).
